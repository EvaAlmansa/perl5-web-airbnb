The square is busy (great for people watching) but the apartment is quiet, and stylish, inside. There are lots of lovely things to look at in the display cases in the living room, a piano to play in the hallway, and COMFORTABLE beds in the bedrooms. We were guided in by Gloria and met at the apartment by Martin who was charming and welcoming. There was a delicious bottle of wine waiting for us, and lots of recommendations from Gloria for good places to eat and visit. The square is the perfect location from which to explore all of the attractions Granada has to offer, which we did on foot, except for one bus journey which we made more out of curiosity than necessity. We met with Gloria before leaving town - she is just great, brimming with enthusiasm and ultra keen that her guests have the best time possible. Gloria was very proactive before we arrived, she offered to help with tickets for transport and attractions and was able to help with translating an email we had from a booking we had made ourselves. I would definitely recommend staying at one of her properties - she is a genuine super host.","id":110324798,"localized_date":"October 2016","created_at":"2016-10-25T11:30:32Z","response":"","review_vote":{"downvote_count":null,"has_upvoted":false,"listing_id":15418621,"review_id":110324798,"upvote_count":null},"reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Gloria","host_name":"Gloria","id":13416400,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/13416400/profile_pic/1441866980/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/13416400"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Rachel","host_name":"Rachel","id":36741906,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c6e15138-705f-46f6-83bb-0cd1b4d7f60a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/36741906"}}],"visible_review_count":4,"select_listing_tenets":null,"hide_from_search_engines":false,"p3_neighborhood_breadcrumb_details":[{"link_route":"/s/Granada--Spain","link_text":"Granada,","search_text":"Granada, Spain"},{"link_route":"/s/Andalucía--Spain","link_text":"Andalucía,","search_text":"Andalucía, Spain"},{"link_route":"/s/Spain","link_text":"Spain","search_text":"Spain"}],"p3_seo_breadcrumb_details":[{"link_route":"/s/Spain","link_text":"Spain","search_text":"Spain"},{"link_route":"/s/Andalucía--Spain","link_text":"Andalucía","search_text":"Andalucía, Spain"},{"link_route":"/s/Granada--Spain","link_text":"Granada","search_text":"Granada, Spain"}],"p3_seo_property_search_url":"/s/Granada--Spain","seo_features":{"android_alternate_url":"android-app://com.airbnb.android/airbnb/rooms/15418621","android_deeplink":"airbnb://rooms/15418621","canonical_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15418621","iphone_deeplink":"airbnb://rooms/15418621","meta_description":"Jun 14, 2017 - Entire home/apt for €110.
